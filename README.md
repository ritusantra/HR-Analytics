Created HR analytics report on Power BI on **Organizational Overview**, **Demographic Analysis** and **Employee Turnover Analysis**.

Various **DAX formulas** were used to define custom calculations like the **employee retention**, **turnover rates** and **number of employees from each gender**.
Based on the data, visulaizations were created to represent the insights in form of **line graphs**, **clustered bar charts**, **clustered column charts** and **area charts**.
